# Tetris Game
### Description:
This is by far one of my most tedious java projects. My parthner and i were tasked with implementing the classic Tetris game in java. We created multiple classses and functions which handled certain functionalities of the game. The project had a total of 11 classes. The Game class alone, which controled everything partaining the gameplay, housed a total of 28 functions controlling a varity of the game mechanics. After the completion of this project i fully acknowledged that any coding problem can be solved if broken into bits.

### How To Install:
* Simply clone the github repository using any IDE that supports java
* After cloning the repository, wait for the project to build 
* Navigate to the **TetrisWindow.Java** and run the file

### Usage
* This open-source simple Tetris game can serve as a valuable educational tool for learning programming concepts, especially object-oriented programming, algorithms, and game development. It also provides a base for developers to experiment with and expand upon, fostering creativity and collaboration within the open-source community.
